### Install dependencies

This project is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure you have Node.js installed before installing the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

You need to install [Overwolf](https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download) too.

### Build project

You can build a production version of the server and client with:

```
npm run build
```

It is required to call this at least once before you can run this app in development mode.

### Install as "unpacked extension"

Based on this [guide](https://overwolf.github.io/docs/start/sample-app-overview#5-install-the-app-as-unpacked-extension) you can install the app.

- Open the Overwolf desktop client settings (by right-clicking the client and selecting "Packages"
  Or by clicking on the wrench icon in the dock and going to the "About" tab => "Development Options").

- Click on "Development options".

- In the opened window, click on "Load unpacked extension" and select the extracted 'ts/dist' folder.
  This will add the app to your Overwolf dock.

- Make sure you are logged in to the OW client. Otherwise, you will get an "Unauthorized App" error message. (Click on the "Appstore" icon in the OW dock to login to the OW client).

### Run development

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the server and client in development mode.

### Start the app
